<p>Hello. I am a Computer Science student from Panama visiting Stanford for the summer Semester. I studied in the Technological University of Panama and the FSU branch in Panama for a few years beforing transfering to the U.S.</p>
<p>I learned about the programs in Stanford a few years ago watching Computer Science lectures available through Youtube and MOOCs in the NOVA platform. My dad told me that if I ever had the chance to visit for a summer semester 
I should try it out. I've learned so much since arriving to <span class="stanford">Stanford</span>. Not only in classes but also outside
of them. I've had the opportunity also to learn about cultural and political issues currently happening in the U.S.</p> 
<p>My areas of interest are deep learning, self-driving cars and machine learning. In fact, the person that got me interested in these areas is a professor at 
<span class="stanford">Stanford</span>.</p>
<p>My hobbies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing/watching talking about soccer <a href="https://youtu.be/3lsVkGQ2eo0">
(I love this sport)</a></li>
<li>Reading comics and novels</li>
<li>Listening to Music <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/effr22/playlist/4s492I1dppZjDtJFuLZnVC">
(Here is a playlist of some music from South America I enjoy)</a></li>
<li>Dancing</li>
<li>Learning new languages</li>
 </ul>
